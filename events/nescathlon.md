# NEScathlon Prep Status #

**Tetris**: Can complete at level 5 mostly reliably.  Not very fast, but I think it's good enough for now and probably forever.

**Spartan X 2**: [PB is 7:42](https://www.speedrun.com/spartanx2/run/ywpe312z).  Good enough, play once a week to stay fresh.

**RoboCop**: [PB is 10:30](https://www.speedrun.com/RoboCop_NES/run/zq6lqq5y).  Next play should be derust closer to the event.

**Whomp 'Em**: I have no idea what I am doing, and my attempt to muddle through didn't go anywhere quickly.  **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Contra**: [Any% PB is 11:22](https://www.speedrun.com/Contra/run/yo2vlqdz), [Low% PB is 13:54](https://www.speedrun.com/Contra/run/z515v0em).  Play every 2 or 3 days to stay fresh.  Do not grind now.

**TMNT**: I need to learn this from the ground up.  I've aborbsed very little from watching WR attempts.  **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Super Mario Bros**:  I can play this fast casual, but I should learn the actual strats.

**Ninja Gaiden 2**:  I can slowly grind my way through this the final boss, but it is super slow and I couldn't beat the boss.  I need to learn this game from a tutorial (probably jimmypoopins' easy tutorial + the RGLtv one).  **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Gargoyle's Quest 2**: Played it long enough to confirm that it seems very much like the GB GQ.  I think I can wait for the tutorial and just use it to get to "good enough" quickly. **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Legend of Zelda**: Was able to follow the blue ring route from the website and beat the game.  My first real trouble was the final dungeon.  If I can get the other games under better control, I should come back to this and learn a faster route.
