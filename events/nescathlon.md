# NEScathlon Prep Status #

## Totally Not Ready - **NEEDS ATTENTION** ##
* Gargoyle's Quest 2: Need to watch tutorial and get some runs in.
* Super Mario Bros - If I can reliably beat world 8 in, say, two or three continues... maybe I'll move it down.

## Not Quite Ready ##
* TMNT: There are a few places where my runs go to die, but I have also finished a few runs as well.
* Ninja Gaiden 2:  I can bumble through the game in 30-40 minutes now. Meh.
* TLOZ - Pratice Blue Ring route more for confidence, then decide if I want to learn a faster route.
* Whomp 'Em: I can almost reliably beat it, but there are a couple of places where I sometimes just die.  I think I little bit of save state practice + some no reset runs will fix that.

## Good Enough For the Marathon ##
* Tetris - Start at level 5 or 6, just go slow and safe.
* RoboCop - If in doubt with the ED-209s, just block and miss the cycle.
* Contra - 1CC is typical for me now.
* Spartan X 2 - Just kicking Naifu seems safer than jump kicks.
