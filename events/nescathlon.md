## Totally Not Ready ##

**Ninja Gaiden 2**:  I can slowly grind my way through this the final boss, but it is super slow and I couldn't beat the boss.  I need to learn this game from a tutorial (probably jimmypoopins' easy tutorial + the RGLtv one).  **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Whomp 'Em**: I have no idea what I am doing, and my attempt to muddle through didn't go anywhere quickly.  **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**TMNT**: I need to learn this from the ground up.  I've aborbsed very little from watching WR attempts.  **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Super Mario Bros**:  I can play this fast casual, but I should learn the actual strats.

**Gargoyle's Quest 2**: Played it long enough to confirm that it seems very much like the GB GQ.  I think I can wait for the tutorial and just use it to get to "good enough" quickly. **NEEDS ATTENTION**

**Legend of Zelda**: Was able to follow the blue ring route from the website and beat the game.  My first real trouble was the final dungeon.  If I can get the other games under better control, I should come back to this and learn a faster route.

## Not Quite Ready ##
* Super Mario Bros - Make reference material for mazes, then practice to see how I feel.
* TLOZ - Pratice Blue Ring route more for confidence, then decide if I want to learn a faster route.

## Good Enough For the Marathon ##
* Tetris - Start at level 5 or 6, just go slow and safe.
* RoboCop - If in doubt with the ED-209s, just block and miss the cycle.
* Contra - 1CC is typical for me now, and that's my goal.
* Spartan X 2 - Just kicking Naifu seems safer than jump kicks.
