## Not Quite Ready ##
* TLOZ - Pratice Blue Ring route more for confidence, then decide if I want to learn a faster route.
* TMNT: There are a few places where my runs go to die, but I have also finished a few runs as well.
* Ninja Gaiden 2:  I can bumble through the game in 30-40 minutes now. Meh.
* Super Mario Bros - Still slow, but good enough to finish.

## Good Enough For the Marathon ##
* Gargoyle's Quest 2: Doppleganger and the final two bosses could use some practice, but otherwise ready.
* Whomp 'Em - Ice boss gets rusty quickly.  Save state practice the final level so I don't have to slow down and grind there.
* Tetris - Start at level 7 or 8, just go slow and safe.
* RoboCop - If in doubt with the ED-209s, just block and miss the cycle.
* Contra - 1CC is typical for me now.  Practice waterfall (for consistency/safety) and snow field (easy gains)
* Spartan X 2 - Just kicking Naifu seems safer than jump kicks.
