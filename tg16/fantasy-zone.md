Stage 1:
Kill first two bases, buy the jet engine at the store.  Hold right and line up on the bases to burn them down (memorize the pattern)

Boss 1:
There are a couple of vertical pixels where you can line up to get a quick kill (kill boss before the first wave of shots gets to you).

Stage 2:
Just shoot all the bases.

Boss 2:
Practice getting as close to the outer ring of spinning balls as possible, and line up either on the center-line or lower.  That should let you one-cycle the boss.

Stage 3:
Kill the first, then hit the store.  Buy 7-way and a single heavy bomb.  Finish the stage

Boss 3:
Line up right-under (or just right of center) underneath the fin of the boss.  When it becomes vulnerable, drop the heavy bomb.  It should sweep off all the turret, giving a quick kill

Stage 4:
Go straight up to the store, buy 3 smart bombs.  Go back to the ground and kill all the bases

Boss 4:
Wait until it can take damage and shoot the 3 smart bombs.

Stage 5:
Kill the upper-right base, then hit the store.  Buy 7-way, then finish the level.

Boss 5:
There is a trade-off: the closer you are, the more likely you will hit all the snowmen enough to kill them as you sweep up and down... but that means you are closer to them shooting.

Level 6:
Buy 7-way, finish the level

Boss 6:
I just shoot it, but you can also time a heavy bomb to be inside the boss just as it forms.  Also: 7-way for just a half second will shred the boss, but it is difficult to get to the boss with enough time left on the gun

Level 7:
Buy smart bombs at the store before starting.  You'll have to fight the third boss without heavy, but you will have extra smart bombs for everyone else.

Boss 7:
The first 4 aliens more or less move up first, then left (initially).  As you are shooting the fourth alien, try to line up in the middle so the 4th and 5th aliens (which charge straight down the middle) can get burnt down before they hit you.
