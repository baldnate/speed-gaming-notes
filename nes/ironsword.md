Credit to snibbers' run and the notes on SDA.  I'll try not to dwell on stuff that can just be watched/read from those.



Mountain:
Straight forward platforming.

Clouds:
Get the magic, get the two magic bubble fountains, and grab the key next to the second bubble with magic.  If you get a lucky random magic bubble spawn before you leave the magic scroll room then there is a extra life you can snag with magic without too much time loss.

Forest:
Straight forward platforming.

Drop to water caverns:
There is a secret room in here that will cost you, say... 10 seconds?  But it has a couple of big gems and an extra life in it.  I grab it.

Water cave:
There are two magic fountains to get here.  Snibbers waits before triggering the second one because the floating score numbers will prevent as many magic bubbles from spawning.  He is waiting for the scores to go off screen.

IF YOU DON'T TOTALLY FILL YOUR MAGIC METER HERE THEN YOU WON'T HAVE THE INFINITE MAGIC GLITCH FOR THE REST OF THE RUN.

Volcano exterior:
Buy the fleece, grab the crown.  Just above and to the right of the crown door is another extra life you can snag pretty easily with your magic, at a cost of a few seconds.

Volcano interior:
Straight forward platforming.  The purple people eaters are horrible.  The skull shooters can be shot once you know the places to fire from.  The boss is a great way to lose time to slightly off-timed shots :-(

NOTE: For some reason the ironsword part grab acts funny in this room.  

Earth caves:
Once you get the movement for getting in and out of the tankard cave it feels great... but it took me a while.  You only need the tankard to rise enough to touch it, which is about as long as it takes to run across the tiny platform.

Earth caves 2:
Straight forward platforming.  You can get sniped here; not much to be done about it :-(

Final part grab:
The thing happening here is multi-stage.  First, go over to the door.  Then, go into the magic menu, but just exit (don't cast fleece!).  That will trigger the part grab cutscene, but you'll be able to leave it early (instead of having to listen to the full fanfare).  Then you still need to shoot the part to leave (up+left+B hits it from the door).

Final stage:
Straight forward platforming.

Final boss:
Please fill in this section Toad wfr4

Really though, watch my video for the slow safer strat.  Snibbers' technique is amazing but I don't know how to do it right.
