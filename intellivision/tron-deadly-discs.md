# TRON: Deadly Discs - Speed Notes #
## Nate's TODOs ##
* I currently don't shatter discs or jam doors on purpose.
** While this makes sense in early waves when it is easy to quickly clear the warriors, I'm pretty sure it doesn't make sense in later waves when it is much more difficult to score the quick clear bonus.
** I suspect that will mean picking a time to switch to purposely summoning the recognizer every other round (probably after 200K)
* I don't optimize when I cross point thresholds to the next multiplier.  I need to do more analysis there.
* The wave bonus is applied at the same WPV as the last warrior killed.
** In other words, the last warrior killed in a quick wave kill is worth 6X WPV
** In other other words, the last warrior killed won't bump you to the next multipler before the 5X bonus gets tallied.

## Nate's Current Routes ##
### Score Attack ###
#### General Tips ####
* Avoid recognizers.  They are worth 10 WPV, but take too much time on average vs. the 8-11 WPV you can earn by clearing a warrior wave quickly.
* The only sure way to avoid recognizers is to not jam any doors.
* Between waves, line up on the intersection of the N/S and E/W center doors.  Note that this is not the same as the intersection of the center grid lines.
#### 0-10K ####
* Only light blue warriors spawn.
* Agressively kill these warriors. Move close to them to minimize flight time.
* When possible, go for multiple kills on a single throw.  However, don't waste time trying to line up a double or triple kill if two or three shots would actually be faster.
#### 10K-200K ####
* Bulldogs and leaders start to spawn, first just one per wave, then two.
* Leaders can spawn with one of three discs: normal dark blue, double damage brown, and homing white (rarely at this point).
* Still be aggressive, but be mindful of the double damage leaders.
* Remember that the bulldog takes two hits in rapid succession to kill.  Plan accordingly
#### 200K-1M ####
* No more light blue warriors spawn: only bulldogs and leaders.
* Most waves will have a homing disc in play.
* At this point I start hugging the walls to force the homing discs to bounce off of them.  This slows down my wave clear times, often forcing respawns.  Blocking might be a better option, but blocking is slow and inconsistent.

## General Tips ##
* Play on the fastest setting - start the game by pressing the disc
* You can recall your disc early by pressing any of the throw buttons while it is in flight.  You should be doing this often.
* Play with two controllers: use the disc on one and the keypad on the other.  This allows you to throw discs while moving.  If you play with a single controller you will have to stop to throw discs.

## Points Racing Strategy ##

All scoring is done in terms of the current warrior point value (WPV).  The WPV is determined by your current score.

| Point Total | Warrior Point Value |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| 0	 | 50  |
| 1000 |	100 |
| 2000 |	150 |
| 3000 |	250 |
| 5000 |	300 |
| 7500 |	500 |
| 10000 |	750 |
| 15000 |	1000 |
| 20000 |	1250 |
| 25000 |	1500 |
| 30000 |	2000 |
| 40000 |	2500 |
| 50000 |	3500 |
| 75000 |	5000 |
| 100000 | 10000 |

You have the following methods of advancing the score:
* Killing a warrior: WPV x 1
* Shattering a disc: WPV x 1
* Killing all warriors before any replacement warriors spawn: WPV x 5
* Killing a recognizer: WPV x 10

In terms of scoring possibilities per wave, you then have the following scoring extrema:
* Minimal quick warrior clear: 8 WPV (3 warriors + 5x bonus)
* Maximal quick warrior clear: 11 WPV (3 warriors + 3 discs broken + 5x bonus)
* Worst slow clear: 4 WPV (3 warriors + 1 respawn warrior)
* Never clear: 2 WPV + 1 WPV every 10 second (1 warrior per 10 sec)
* Recognizer kill: 10 WPV
* Recognizer no kill: 0 points

Each of these has


### 200K Category ###

If we consider the wave as a whole then, you have the following general possibilities:
* Just kill the three warriors before the respawn: WPV x 8
* Kill the three warriors plus one respawn: WPV x 4
